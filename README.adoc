=== Exploring Domain Driven Design w/ Klondike

This repository contains an *work in progress* Java/Spring based client/server Klondike Solitaire game written in the Domain Driven Design style discussed in http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577/[Implementing Domain Driven Design]. The Solitaire Domain was chosen arbitrarily but actually ended up being a decent domain to play in.

This codebase was written as a way to explore various Domain Driven Design concepts and techniques like using domain events to implement eventual consistency boundaries between aggregate roots. The game is fully playable but the code is not intended to be complete. I have not taken the time to fully test or account for robust messaging. 

I plan to continue building out the sample to include integration with a separate remote bounded context but I wanted to get an early version out there.

.UI
Included in this repository is a JavaScript/HTML5 based UI packaged into an executable JAR. Its design is not very important from a DDD perspective, it was only built in order to be able to play the game. The JSON data contracts used to communicate with the server are worth exploring from a DDD Published Language perspective. It attempts to leverage the https://www.polymer-project.org/[Polymer library], but it was my first time experimenting with it and I may have misused it a bit. As a result the UI currently *only works in Chrome*.

.Installation
The game leverages http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Boot] so almost everything is self-contained. There are two executable JARs that will be created during the multi-project Maven build. The only other thing that is needed is to run the game is a base https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html[RabbitMQ server] alongside the applications.
